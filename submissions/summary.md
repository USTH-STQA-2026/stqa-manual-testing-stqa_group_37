## 4. Phân tích chất lượng phần mềm

### 4.1. Điểm mạnh
----Authentication Security: The login infrastructure functions properly, securely authorizing credentials and catching blank inputs.
----Basic Catalog Integrity: Basic browsing operations, database loading, detailed item summaries, and standard keyword queries operate with consistent stability.
----Standard Operational Flow: The standard processes for straightforward borrowing checkouts and timely book returns run reliably without system interruption.

### 4.2. Điểm yếu
----Broken Authorization Framework: Regular member profiles can easily cross-reference, view, and directly edit or trigger book returns on records belonging to foreign accounts.----Business Rule Bypass: Lack of strict back-end enforcement regarding the maximum loan ceiling allows users to check out a 4th book completely undetected.
----Flawed Boundary Logic: The automated calculation tool contains arithmetic errors that flag loans as overdue on the exact day they are due.
----String Normalization Flaws: The search algorithm does not strip accent markers, preventing users from pulling up results using un-accented keywords.

## 5. Đề xuất ưu tiên sửa lỗi

| Thứ tự | Bug | Mức độ | Lý do ưu tiên |
|--------|-----|--------|---------------|
| 1 | BUG-06 | High | Security vulnerability allowing users to modify or return transactions belonging to other members, potentially corrupting transaction history and audit logs. |
| 2 | BUG-05 | High | Privacy and authorization issue where regular members can access sensitive information of other users. |
| 3 | BUG-02 | High | Core business logic failure allowing users to borrow more than the maximum limit of 3 books, causing inventory inconsistencies. |
| 4 | BUG-07 | High | Data Desynchronization: Causes a mismatch between the current book status schema and the underlying loan transactional logs. |
| 5 | BUG-03 | Medium | Validation logic incorrectly rejects valid email addresses, preventing users from completing registration or update operations. |
| 6 | BUG-04 | Medium | Validation Logic Failure: Locks out correct operational inputs while accidentally processing malformed or corrupted parameters into the database. |
| 7 | BUG-01 | Medium | UX Usability Bottleneck: Harms ease-of-use by yielding completely empty results when searching without explicit Vietnamese text accents. |

## 6. Kết luận

- The system is not ready for release!

Although the software demonstrates reliable performance across fundamental workflows like secure logins and data catalog indexing, it contains major high-risk functional defects. The platform suffers from broken cross-user authorization barriers, missing server-side data validations, and flawed date calculation algorithms. Deploying the system in its present form would trigger massive data leaks and a total failure of library inventory governance. The development cycle must remain open to implement hot-fixes addressing all High and Medium severity items before entering re-verification.

## 7. Bài học rút ra (Tùy chọn)
- Proactive Boundary Mapping: Discovered that analytical engineering requires mapping edge equations explicitly during design to avoid logical code bugs .
- Defensive Back-End Isolation: Realized that access rights must be evaluated strictly through server-side authorization structures rather than safely relying on UI modifications or component hiding.
